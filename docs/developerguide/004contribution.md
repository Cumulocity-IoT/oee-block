# Developer Guide - Contribution Guide
If you identify a bug or want to suggest feature requests, please raise a ticket here: https://github.com/Cumulocity-IoT/oee-block/issues.

If you plan to contribute additional features or bugfixes yourself, please still raise a ticket. Then fork the repository, implement the change and create a pull request to merge the changes back.

Especially in case of complex changes, also provide test cases using the Block SDK: https://github.com/Cumulocity-IoT/apama-analytics-builder-block-sdk/blob/main/doc/035-Testing.md.
