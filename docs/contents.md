# Contents
The documentation is split into three parts. The **User Guide** should be the starting point for regular user of the OEE Block in Cumulocity Analytics Builder. It explains the various configuration options, provides a walk-through of creating a complete model end-to-end, and sketches for more advanced scenarios.

The **Developer Guide** is of interest for people who want to extend the OEE Block. It explains how to report bugs, feature requests and how to do your own extensions of the block, and how to contribute them back to the community.

The **OEE Theory** is taken from the official documentation of the Cumulocity OEE App and provides background and context for the calculation of OEE. Note that not all explanation will apply directly to the OEE block as well.
